Q7
    Symmetric Tree (LeetCode 101)
    https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/description/

### Problem Explanation:
A tree is symmetric if:
- The root node has two subtrees that are mirrors of each other.
- Each subtree's left child mirrors the other subtree's right child.

### Solution Approach:
To determine if the tree is symmetric, 
we need to compare the left and right subtrees recursively. 
We'll use a helper function that checks 
if two trees are mirrors of each other.

def is_two_symmetric(p, q):
    if (not p) and (not q):
        return True 
    if (not p) or (not q):
        return False 
    if p.val != q.val:
        return False 
    return is_two_symmetric(p.left, q.right) and is_two_symmetric(p.right,q.left)

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True 
        
        return is_two_symmetric(root.left, root.right)

Q8
    **Invert Binary Tree (LeetCode 226)**
    https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/

### Problem Explanation:
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Solution Approach:
We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. 
For each node, 
    we swap its left and right children, and 
    then recursively invert 
        the left and right subtrees.
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return root
        ###preorder
        #1.visit -> swap the children
        root.left,root.right=root.right,root.left        
        #2.travel left
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        #3.travel right
        self.invertTree(root.right)

        return root


Q9 
    **Path Sum (LeetCode 112)**
    https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/

### Problem Explanation:
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer target sum, 
determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path 
such that the sum of the node values along the path equals the target sum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

### Solution Approach:
We can solve this problem 
    using a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach. 
For each node, subtract the node's value from the target sum, 
and recursively check its left and right subtrees with the updated sum. 
If we reach a leaf node and the remaining sum equals the leaf's value, 
we have found a valid path.

class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return False
        #is the root is leaf 
        if (not root.left) and (not root.right):
            return targetSum == root.val 
        #other than the leaf 
        targetSum -= root.val 
        return self.hasPathSum(root.left,targetSum) or self.hasPathSum(root.right,targetSum)
