Q4. [Kth Largest Element in an Array]
(https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
**Problem Statement:**
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, 
return the `k`th largest element in the array.

**Solution Approach:**
- **Quickselect Algorithm:** 
Use the quickselect algorithm, 
which is similar to quicksort but only partially sorts the array 
to find the kth largest element. 
This approach has an average time complexity of O(n).

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

------------------------------
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        #print(heapq.nlargest(k,nums))
        return heapq.nlargest(k,nums)[-1]
